### üìù **Project Description: AI Chatbot using NLP in Python**

This project showcases the development of a simple **AI Chatbot** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques in Python. It is part of **Task 3** under the internship at **Codetech IT Solutions**, submitted by **Rishan . N**, a student of **Rajalakshmi Institute of Technology**. The chatbot is built entirely using core Python along with NLP and text processing libraries such as **NLTK**, **Regex**, and **Datetime**.

The chatbot, named **RishanBot**, is capable of handling basic conversation patterns by recognizing user inputs and responding appropriately. It is designed to understand and reply to common user intents like greetings, asking for time, expressing thanks, and saying goodbye. If the chatbot cannot match the user's input to a known intent, it responds with a default fallback message.

**Key Functional Features**:

* **Natural Language Input Recognition**: Uses NLTK and regular expressions to process and understand natural language inputs.
* **Intent Detection**: Matches user messages to predefined intents such as greeting, name inquiry, or time request.
* **Dynamic Time Response**: Utilizes Python‚Äôs `datetime` module to return the current time when asked.
* **Looped Interaction**: The bot remains in conversation mode until the user says "bye", "goodbye", or "exit".
* **Randomized Responses**: For each intent, multiple responses are stored to make conversations feel more dynamic and less repetitive.

This project is a foundational step into the field of conversational AI, helping learners understand how simple rule-based NLP chatbots are structured. While it does not use machine learning or external APIs, it is a strong demonstration of core logic building, pattern matching, and user interaction flow.

In summary, this chatbot reflects the practical application of NLP in creating engaging user experiences and marks a successful completion of Task 3 in the internship.
